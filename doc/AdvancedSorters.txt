DESCRIPTION					 *AdvancedSorters-description*

The built-in |:sort| command is powerful, but it still is line-based. It
doesn't take into account folded lines, nor can it sort entire blocks like
function definitions, paragraphs, etc. But often, one needs to sort exactly
such areas as single entities, i.e. without changing the line order within
them. A workaround in Vim is condensing each block into a single line,
performing the sorting, and then expanding again. (External, more powerful
sort commands could be used, too.)

This plugin implements this workaround and encapsulates the three separate
steps in one handy command.


While |:sort| has several flags for sorting on various numbers, and a
/{pattern}/ can be specified to skip or sort on, it doesn't allow arbitrary
(Vimscript) expressions.

This plugin offers extension commands that evaluate an expression per line,
put that number in front of the line, do a numerical sort, and then remove the
temporary number again. Specializations handle the common sort by number of
characters and by the line's display width.

- The |LineJuggler.vim| plugin (vimscript #4140) offers many quick mappings to
  move around (blocks of) lines. For small data sets, manual shifting may be
  quicker than coming up with a correct sort command.

USAGE						       *AdvancedSorters-usage*
								*:SortVisible*
:[range]SortVisible[!] [i][u][r][n][x][o] [/{pattern}/]
			Sort visible lines in the buffer / [range]. Lines
			inside closed folds are kept intact; sorting is done
			on all lines of the fold as one unit; i.e. the order
			of the other lines inside the fold does _not_ change!
							 *:SortRangesByHeader*
:[range]SortRangesByHeader[!] /{expr}/ [i][u][r][n][x][o] [/{pattern}/]
			Each match of {expr} (in the buffer / [range]) starts
			a new area that sorts as one unit; i.e. the order of
			the other lines inside the area does _not_ change!
			Lines before the first header are sorted individually.
							  *:SortRangesByMatch*
:[range]SortRangesByMatch[!] /{expr}/ [i][u][r][n][x][o] [/{pattern}/]
			Each (multi-line) match of {expr} (in the buffer /
			[range]) defines an area that sorts as one unit,
			together with individual non-matching lines.
							  *:SortRangesByRange*
:[range]SortRangesByRange[!] {range} [i][u][r][n][x][o] [/{pattern}/]
			Each {range} (in the buffer / [range]) defines an area
			that sorts as one unit.
			Note: For this command, /{pattern}/ must be separated
			from the {range} by a [i][u][r][n][x][o] flag or a
			space; you cannot directly concatenate them.

			Note: The text must not contain embedded <Nul>
			characters (^@) for the above commands!

:[range]ReorderVisible {reorder-expr}
			Reorder visible lines in the buffer / [range] by
			collecting into a List of Strings (multiple folded
			lines are joined with newlines) and passing it (as
			v:val) to {reorder-expr}.
:[range]ReorderFolded {reorder-expr}
			Reorder folded lines in the buffer / [range] by
			collecting into a List of Strings (multiple folded
			lines are joined with newlines) and passing it (as
			v:val) to {reorder-expr}. Those are then re-inserted
			in between any unfolded lines, which stay as they
			were.
:[range]ReorderUnfolded {reorder-expr}
			Reorder unfolded lines in the buffer / [range] by
			collecting into a List of Strings (subsequent unfolded
			lines are joined with newlines) and passing it (as
			v:val) to {reorder-expr}. Those are then re-inserted
			in between any closed folds, which stay as they were.
:[range]ReorderByHeader /{expr}/ {reorder-expr}
			Each match of {expr} (in the buffer / [range]) starts
			a new area that is reordered as one unit (joined with
			newlines) by passing it (as v:val) to {reorder-expr}.
			Lines before the first header are reordered as another
			single unit.
:[range]ReorderOnlyByMatch /{expr}/ {reorder-expr}
			Each (multi-line) match of {expr} (in the buffer /
			[range]) defines an area that is reordered as one unit
			(joined with newlines) by passing it (as v:val) to
			{reorder-expr}. Those are then re-inserted in between
			any non-matching lines, which stay as they were.
:[range]ReorderByMatchAndNonMatches /{expr}/ {reorder-expr}
			Each (multi-line) match of {expr} (in the buffer /
			[range]) defines an area that is reordered as one unit
			(joined with newlines), together with units of
			non-matching lines, by passing it (as v:val) to
			{reorder-expr}.
:[range]ReorderByMatchAndLines /{expr}/ {reorder-expr}
			Each (multi-line) match of {expr} (in the buffer /
			[range]) defines an area that is reordered as one unit
			(joined with newlines), together with individual
			non-matching lines, by passing it (as v:val) to
			{reorder-expr}.
:[range]ReorderOnlyByRange {range} {reorder-expr}
			Each {range} (in the buffer / [range]) defines an area
			that is reordered as one unit (joined with newlines),
			together with units of non-matching lines, by passing
			it (as v:val) to {reorder-expr}.
:[range]ReorderByRangeAndNonMatches {range} {reorder-expr}
			Each {range} (in the buffer / [range]) defines an area
			that is reordered as one unit (joined with newlines),
			together with individual non-matching lines, by
			passing it (as v:val) to {reorder-expr}.

								 *:SortByExpr*
:[range]SortByExpr[!] {expr}
			Sort lines in [range] by the {expr}, which should take
			the current line as input via v:val and return a
			number. With [!] the order is reversed.
							   *:SortByExprUnique*
:[range]SortByExprUnique[!] {expr}
			Sort lines in [range] by the {expr}; only the first
			line that gets a certain number from {expr} is kept.
			With [!] the order is reversed.
							   *:SortByCharLength*
:[range]SortByCharLength[!]
			Sort lines in [range] by the number of characters.
								*:SortByWidth*
:[range]SortByWidth[!]
			Sort lines in [range] by the display width.

								   *:SortEach*
:[range]SortEach /{delimiter-pattern}/[{joiner}/]
:[range]SortEach /{delimiter-pattern}/[{joiner}]/ [i][u][r][n][x][o] /{pattern}/
			Sort individual elements delimited by
			{delimiter-pattern} (or newlines) in the current line
			/ [range], and join them back together with the first
			matching delimiter [or {joiner}].
								  *:SortWORDs*
:[range]SortWORDs[!] [i][u][r][n][x][o] [/{pattern}/]
			Sort individual (whitespace-delimited) |WORDs| in the
			current line / [range].

								    *:UniqAny*
:[range]UniqAny [i][r] [/{pattern}/]
			Remove lines in [range] that have already been
			encountered earlier (not necessarily adjacent).
			With [i] case is ignored.
			When /{pattern}/ is specified and there is no [r] flag
			the text matched with {pattern} is ignored.
			With [r] only the matching {pattern} is considered;
			the rest is ignored.
			If a {pattern} is used, any lines which don't have a
			match for {pattern} are kept.
							     *:UniqSubsequent*
:[range]UniqSubsequent [i][r] [/{pattern}/]
			Remove second and succeeding copies of repeated
			adjacent lines in [range].
			With [i] case is ignored.
			When /{pattern}/ is specified and there is no [r] flag
			the text matched with {pattern} is ignored.
			With [r] only the matching {pattern} is considered;
			the rest is ignored.
			If a {pattern} is used, any lines which don't have a
			match for {pattern} are kept.

EXAMPLE						     *AdvancedSorters-example*

We're taking any Vimscript file with multiple function definitions as an
example, and show how to sort whole functions according to function name (and
arguments).

To use folding, we first have to define the folds, then trigger the sorting: >
    :g/^function/,/^endfunction/fold
    :SortVisible

If we don't care about including any lines after the "endfunction", we can
just base the areas on the function start: >
    :SortRangesByHeader /^function/
But we'll get better results with an explicit end. One way is to define a
multi-line pattern that covers the entire function: >
    :SortRangesByMatch /^function\_.\{-}\nendfunction$/
Another way spans up a range, similar to what we've done above to define the
folds: >
    :SortRangesByRange /^function/,/^endfunction$/
